# 1. Best Practices for Interface Custom Marshaling 
(For an overview of using the Enclave Definition Language (EDL) and the oeedger8r tool to produce enclave interface code, please refer to [Getting started with the Open Enclave edger8r](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedDocs/Edger8rGettingStarted.md).)

Calling into and out of enclaves uses special methods that orchestrate the context switch and marshal the function parameters. Much of the code necessary to manage these calls and parameter marshaling are common to most applications. The Open Enclave _oeedger8r_, using the interface definition defined by application developers in EDL files, generates boilerplate code for them.

In some uncommon cases, developers may want to pass data types that are not defined at the interface level or handle marshaling differently from what the oeedger8r tool generates. To specify this, use `user_check` for the parameter constraint like the following example:

```c++
enclave{
    trusted {
        public void ecall_with_user_check(
            [user_check] void* blob);
    };
};
```
In this simplified EDL example, the function takes one pointer-to-void parameter. Remember that the primary benefit of using supported types in the EDL is that the generated boiler-plate code performs the necessary and secure marshaling for the developer. When developers specify that a parameter is `user_check`, they are signaling to oeedger8r that their application code will perform the marshaling. (Two examples of when custom marshaling is helpful are 1) when data formats are dynamic, and 2) when sharing large blocks of memory -- custom marshaling avoids the boiler-plate code's intermediate copying of data into safe in-enclave buffers.) 

> We'd like to stress that a secure best practice for enclave interfaces is to _avoid_ custom marshaling. But we understand that there may be cases where avoiding it is impractical, so in these sections we will help developers do it safely.

The ecall function implementation below has several problems. We will be correcting this code as we move through the material. The general impetus for custom marshaling in this sample code is to avoid expensive intermediate copying of shared memory introduced by the oeedger8r's generated code. (Data passed to `render_data()` is "flat", that is, the data format is non-referential and thus non-_self_-referencing. These attributes reduce threats to enclaves from untrusted data streams. More on this in the following sections.)

```c++
typedef struct _blob {
    void* data;
    size_t size;
} blob_t;

// WARNING: Portions of this code are intentionally flawed to demonstrate common pitfalls.
int ecall_with_user_check0(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;

    if (ptr == nullptr)
        return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

    // blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K
    if (blob->size > 4096)
        return -1;

    return render_data(blob->data, blob->size);
}
```

## 1.1 Ensuring memory is where it should be

Remember that the code we are focused on is running _inside_ of the enclave. The host caller invoked this function from _outside_ the enclave, passing in a pointer to host memory containing well-formed data (in the non-malicious case). But in the Open Enclave security model, the host caller is untrusted - we must treat untrusted input with caution. 

One important security check is to ensure that memory blocks are on the correct side of the security boundary. It's common for host applications to pass host memory blocks to the enclave, as is the case with this example code. The Open Enclave SDK provides two library functions for checking memory buffers: `oe_is_within_enclave()` and `oe_is_outside_enclave()`.

Let's update the code to ensure that the memory block is at least the size of a `blob_t` and is located _strictly_ outside the secured enclave memory region before operating on it by calling `oe_is_outside_enclave()`.

```diff
// WARNING: Portions of this code are intentionally flawed to demonstrate common pitfalls.
int ecall_with_user_check1(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;

-   if (ptr == nullptr)
-       return -1;
+   // Ensure passed-in pointer is not null and the memory block is located entirely outside of the enclave.
+   if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(ptr, sizeof(blob_t)))
+       return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

    // Blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K.
    if (blob->size > 4096)
        return -1;

    return render_data(blob->data, blob->size);
}
```
## 1.2 SGX enclaves: oe_is_within_enclave vs. oe_is_outside_enclave

Let's highlight a logical mistake that we've seen made with SGX-based enclaves. Some have regarded the memory validation functions as boolean opposites of each other, that is: `oe_is_within_enclave() == !oe_is_outside_enclave()`. This is incorrect for several reasons.

To understand why this function pair are _not_ boolean opposites, it helps to consider the SGX implementation: [memory.c](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave/blob/08ebe60c1d2e3ea24ac634c673a420296bff3352/enclave/core/sgx/memory.c). There are three conditions that the functions validate:
1)	The pointer is not null.
2)	The bounding arithmetic operations do not wrap (i.e. numerical overflow).
3)	The block lies completely within or outside of the enclave.

The first two conditions should make clear the pitfalls of considering the function pair to be boolean opposites: If the pointer is null or the bounding calculations overflow in a call to `oe_is_within_enclave()`, the function will return `false`, which should _not_ be interpreted as "the memory is outside the enclave". 

The last condition is subtle: In some potentially malicious cases, the memory range may be both partially within and partially outside the enclave, spanning the boundary between the two. (Attacks against enclaves may use memory confusion to achieve overwrites of protected regions, for example.) Both functions will return `false` when the memory range spans the boundary - another reason the function pair are not boolean opposites.

## 1.3 TOCTOU or double fetch vulnerabilities

One class of vulnerabilities that custom marshaling code should protect against is referred to as time-of-check/time-of-use, or TOCTOU. Another name for this problem is "double-fetch". The problem arises when memory is shared across privilege boundaries. As code validates input, it's critical that data is not fetched twice (or, strictly, more than once), allowing a malicious untrusted caller to change the data between the time-of-check and the time-of-use. Let's examine our function:

```c++
// WARNING: Portions of this code are intentionally flawed to demonstrate common pitfalls.
int ecall_with_user_check2(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;

    // Ensure passed-in pointer is not null and the memory block is located entirely outside of the enclave.
    if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(ptr, sizeof(blob_t)))
        return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

    // Blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K.
    if (blob->size > 4096) //TOCTOU: First fetch
        return -1;

    return render_data(blob->data, blob->size); //TOCTOU: Second fetch
}
```
There's nothing wrong with the first fetch: The value is validated, and the appropriate logic branch is taken. The problem arises when the code needs the value again and reads it, once again, from the untrusted memory location outside of the enclave. Between the first and subsequent fetch the value may have been changed, neutralizing the size validation, and possibly leading to some enclave memory corruption that is helpful to the attacker. Let's protect the enclave by "capturing" the values.

> When "capturing" data values in this context, it's important to protect against the compiler's optimization, hence we use the `volatile` qualifier for our local captured variables. Otherwise, the compiler might optimize-away our local variable, removing the TOCTOU protection.

```diff
// WARNING: Portions of this code are intentionally flawed to demonstrate common pitfalls.
int ecall_with_user_check3(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;
+   void* volatile captured_data;
+   volatile size_t captured_size;

    // Ensure passed-in pointer is not null and the memory block is located entirely outside of the enclave.
    if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(ptr, sizeof(blob_t)))
        return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

+   // Capture blob descriptors to avoid TOCTOU problems.
+   captured_data = blob->data;
+   captured_size = blob->size;

    // Blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K.
-   if (blob->size > 4096) //TOCTOU: First fetch
+   if (captured_size > 4096)
        return -1;

-   return render_data(blob->data, blob->size); //TOCTOU: Second fetch
+   return render_data(captured_data, captured_size);
}
```

## 1.4 Ensure proper bounding of data buffers

Another element of marshaling code is ensuring, as complex structures are parsed, that nested structures are also within the outer bounds. This is especially important for internal functions like `render_data()` that may be unaware that the memory is untrusted. Use the same techniques on the inner structures that were used on the outer.

> A warning about legacy data-parsers: Take care when passing "hot" data to code that may not have been written to parse maliciously crafted input. We have seen cases where legacy code that parses self-formatting or self-refencing data was used in new enclave applications. This can lead to significant vulnerabilities if the data being parsed is still controlled by the host, as may be the case with custom marshaling. In the case of this sample code, as mentioned earlier, `render_data()` parses "flat" data that is not nested nor self-referencing, so it's safe (and performant) to pass it "hot" data that is controlled by the host. Care must be taken though, to avoid data-consistency and other app-level integrity problems.

```diff
int ecall_with_user_check4(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;
    void* volatile captured_data;
    volatile size_t captured_size;

    // Ensure passed-in pointer is not null and the memory block is located entirely outside of the enclave.
    if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(ptr, sizeof(blob_t)))
        return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

    // Capture blob descriptors to avoid TOCTOU problems.
    captured_data = blob->data;
    captured_size = blob->size;

    // Blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K.
    if (captured_size > 4096)
        return -1;

+   // Ensure validity of nested structure
+   if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(captured_data, captured_size))
+       return -1;

+   // Data parsed by render_data is "flat", non-self-referencing.
    return render_data(captured_data, captured_size);
}
```
## 1.5 Corrected enclave ecall with custom marshaling

Thanks for sticking with us. Here is our corrected ecall function that marshals the parameter correctly:
```c++
int ecall_with_user_check5(void* ptr) {

    blob_t* blob;
    void* volatile captured_data;
    volatile size_t captured_size;

    // Ensure passed-in pointer is not null and the memory block is located entirely outside of the enclave.
    if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(ptr, sizeof(blob_t)))
        return -1;

    blob = (blob_t*)ptr;

    // Capture blob descriptors to avoid TOCTOU problems.
    captured_data = blob->data;
    captured_size = blob->size;

    // Blobs to be rendered are limited to 4K.
    if (captured_size > 4096)
        return -1;

    // Ensure validity of nested structure
    if (!oe_is_outside_enclave(captured_data, captured_size))
        return -1;

    // Data parsed by render_data is "flat", non-self-referencing.
    return render_data(captured_data, captured_size);
}
```

# 2. Handling Secrets in Enclave Applications

Open Enclave is an SDK that helps developers build apps that will run inside a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). At their core, TEEs protect application code and data at runtime from the host environment. Without new, hardware-implemented protections, a malicious or compromised host operating system would be able to modify code or read data. Any secrets managed by an application during runtime would be at risk of exposure. Open Enclave SDK helps developers build applications that are protected from these threats.

> It's important to note that enclaves do not provide _code confidentiality_. This is noteworthy in the context of this discussion because, as will be discussed, hard-coded credentials in application code are to be avoided -- with or without enclave protections.

Enclaves provide new trust boundary protections that address old threats and open new capabilities. But just as Open Enclave and TEEs shift the security model, application developers must shift how they handle data, especially secrets, like keys and passwords.

## 2.1 How _Not_ to Handle Application Secrets
Let's remind ourselves of a way _not_ to handle application secrets. A common example of this well-discussed application weakness is described by [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (4.4) (mitre.org)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html). While application security is often a tradeoff between multiple factors and broad edicts are not always appropriate, it's not controversial to simply say that hard-coding credentials in application code _should not be done_.

## 2.2 The New, Secure Enclave Way to Handle Application Secrets

Enclaves provide two properties that enable applications to handle secrets securely: 1) strong identity, 2) runtime protection of secrets in memory. These two properties enable secure point-to-point secret transfers. When applications are built with enclaves, all secret management should occur dynamically _inside_ the enclave and through secure communications with trusted sources, such as cloud provider key vaults. Let's look at one example of how enclave attestation and enclave memory protection can combine to implement a secure channel.

### Secure Key Release
One of the core challenges customers have interacting with encrypted environments is how to ensure that they can securely and reliably communicate with the code running in the environment ("enclave code").

One solution to this problem is what is known as "Secure Key Release", which is a pattern that enables this kind of communication with enclave code.

To implement the "Secure Key Release" pattern, the enclave code generates an ephemeral asymmetric key. It then serializes the public portion of the key to some format (possibly a JSON Web Key, or PEM, or some other serialization format).
The enclave code then calculates the SHA256 value of the public key and passes it as an input to code which generates an SGX Quote. For Open Enclave, this is done with `oe_get_evidence` or `oe_get_report`.

The client then sends the SGX quote and the serialized key to the attestation service. The attestation service will validate the quote and ensure that the hash of the key is present in the quote and will issue an "Attestation Token".

The client can then send that Attestation Token (which contains the serialized key) to a 3rd party "relying party". The relying party then validates that the attestation token was created by the attestation service, and thus the serialized key can be used to encrypt some data held by the "relying party" to send to the service.
